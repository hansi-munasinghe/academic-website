I have been an educator in one form or another pretty much my whole adult life - starting as a substitute teacher the day after I graduated high school, tutoring throughout college, and serving as a [teaching assistant and instructor for 8+ years](#teaching-experience) at the University of Iowa. I have also engaged in formal [training](#training-in-teaching-and-pedagogy), as well as [research and writing](#Teaching-Focused-Research-and-Writing) related to teaching and pedagogy. I was awarded the University of Iowa Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award in 2020. 

What I enjoy most about teaching is empowering students to use social scientific methods to ask questions and generate solutions. My teaching philosophy is driven by three overarching goals: to teach sociology from an intersectional lens, to demystify the process of sociological knowledge production, and to elevate voices that are underrepresented and marginalized.

# Teaching-Focused Research and Writing

&nbsp;

#### How instructors can incorporate *Ear Hustle* -- a podcast produced and recorded by people in prison -- to teach about mass incarceration.
In a review published in the journal *Teaching Sociology*, I wrote about how instructors can incorporate [*Ear Hustle*](https://www.earhustlesq.com/), a podcast produced and recorded by people in prison, as class material in a range of sociology courses to help students learn about the far-reaching impacts of mass incarceration by hearing directly from those impacted.

#### *Project in Progress:* Utilizing Student-Centered Goal Setting
I am currently conducting a research project on the use of student-centered goal setting. This project is part of the [Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL)](https://www.cirtl.net/) at the University of Iowa.
