My name is Hansini Munasinghe (pronounced *hun-si-nee moo-nuh-sing-huh*).

I am a researcher and sociologist (PhD, University of Iowa). In my work, I use both quantitative and qualitative research methods to better understand how people experience the world we live in.

My scholarly research focuses on international migration, race, gender, and class inequality, and political sociology. My PhD dissertation brings together projects using survey data and in-depth interviews to better understand how immigrants and their families navigate lives across borders and engage socially and politically in their new home societies.

What inspired me to become a sociologist was my experience of working as a freelance journalist in my home country, Sri Lanka. The diverse stories I encountered on my job inspired me to study society more closely. This background influences my writing and commitment to [*Public Sociology*](https://hansimunasinghe.me/public_sociology).

In my free time, I like to read books, make delicious food, explore nature, and try out new hobbies.
