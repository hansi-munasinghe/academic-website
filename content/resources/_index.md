My academic journey would not have been possible without help from mentors, friends, and internet strangers along the way. This page is a (growing) collection of resources that I hope will be helpful to others as well.

> **Are you thinking about going to graduate school / doing a PhD?**
I am always happy to chat with prospective students who are thinking about graduate school. I am especially excited about helping students from Sri Lanka and other countries in the Global South navigate the path to a PhD in the US. [Scholars from the Global South are underrepresented   in academia](https://theconversation.com/global-south-scholars-are-missing-from-european-and-us-journals-what-can-be-done-about-it-99570), especially in the social sciences, and an important step in closing this gap is helping more scholars gain access to education and training at the PhD level *with funding*. I hope I can play a small part in making this possible - I am happy to share my experience, explain the process, help edit application material, and help you find more resources. Please feel free to email me or reach me via socials!

### How to create an academic website like this one!
I created this website in R using blogdown package. While there are many other ways to create a personal website, I chose this because it is cheap/free. Here are resources I found helpful:
* Dr. Dan Quintana's [how-to blogpost](https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/) and [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox_Ue9yzf-0)
