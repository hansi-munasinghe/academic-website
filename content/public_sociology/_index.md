### *Des Moines Register* Op-Ed on International Student Ban
In July 2020, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced that international students taking all courses online during the pandemic will be considered to be in violation of their student visas, and must therefore leave the US immediately or face deportation. This news came as a shock to international students and university communities across the country. Drawing on my scholarly knowledge and my own my own experiences, I wrote an op-ed published in the *Des Moines Register* highlighting the harms of this proposed policy. Following public outcry, ICE soon revoked this decision.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Research Project -- University of Iowa

This project used data collected through surveys and listening sessions to understand issues around campus climate and diversity, equity, and inclusion faced by undergraduate students, graudate students, and faculty and staff at the University of Iowa. These findings informed the DEI strategic plan for the university. As part of this research team, I worked on analysis and presentation of quantitative and qualitative survey data and gained experience in public sociology and science communication.

### Parental Leave Survey Research Project -- University of Iowa

Working in collaboration with the Council on the Status of Women and the UI Public Policy Center at the University of Iowa, this project used survey data to examine experiences around parental leave among faculty and staff at the University of Iowa. As a member of this research team, I analyzed quantitative and qualitative data obtained from the survey and presented findings in a public forum.
